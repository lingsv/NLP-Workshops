I Did It Again,"Calling out your name Your face is everywhere I'm reaching out to you To find that you're not there I wake up every night To see the state I'm in It's like an endless fight I never seem to win  I can't go on As long as I believe Can't let go When I keep wondering  (Chorus:) Where are you now? What have you found? Where is your heart When I'm not around? Where are you now? You gotta let me know Oh Baby, so I can let you go  I can hear your voice The ring of yesterday It seems so close to me but yet so far away I should let it out To save what's left of me And close the doors of doubt Revive my dignity But I can't go on As long as I believe Can't let go while I keep wondering  (Chorus) Where are you now? What have you found? Where is your heart When I'm not around? (Tell me) where are you now? You gotta let me know Oh baby, so I can let you go  I should let it out It's time to let you go Oh baby, I just wanna know  (Chorus x2) Where are you now? What have you found? Where is your heart When I'm not around? Where are you now? You gotta let me know Oh baby, so I can let you go  Where are you now? What have you found? Where is your heart When I'm not around? Where are you now? You gotta let me know Oh Baby, so I can let you go",Britey Spears
